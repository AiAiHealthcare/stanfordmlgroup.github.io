          h2 Description
          p Over the course of Winter Quarter 2018, our bootcamp covers a large breadth of topics at the intersection of artificial intelligence and healthcare. Students take a dive into cutting-edge research with medical imaging and electronic health record data, working closely with Ph.D. students and each other.
          h2 Timeline
          ul
            li Applications due Jan 12th, 2018, 11:59pm.
            li Interviews and selections by Jan 14th, 2018.
            li Bootcamp starts Jan 15th, 2018.
          h2 Requirements
          ul
            li Must be a full-time Stanford student.
            li Should have taken CS221/CS229 or equivalent.
            li Proficiency in Python.
          h2 Commitment
          ul
            li
              | Be able to register for 7 or more independent research units for this bootcamp. 
              i This level of commitment is not consistent with working as an RA or on other research projects simultaneously. It is more like a “full time job” where you’re taking some Stanford courses on the side, rather than a course.
            li
              | Be present at the bootcamp venue 5+ hours/day every weekday.
