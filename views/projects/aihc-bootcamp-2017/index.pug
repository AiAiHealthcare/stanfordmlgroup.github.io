                | Within each reading, find 3 concepts to explain in your own words (12 total). The idea of this exercise is to be able to distill and communicate a machine learning technique into its core idea. We encourage you to pick concepts which you find particularly tough to understand, and want to explore more in depth. You'll present

                | Example: "Bayesian statistics describes an approach to integrate uncertainty into our understanding of the world. Let's say we want to understand how a system works. As Bayesians, we consider all possible designs of the system and decide how probable each possible design of the system is based on our beliefs ("prior"). We also compute the probability of our observations ("evidence") for each possible design ("likelihood"). We can then combine  our prior knowledge and evidence to update our belief ("posterior") about the probabiltity of each design."

                strong Assignment: Patient Risk Prediction 
                | You're tasked with predicting the 10-year probability of heart attack for the general population. You've looked at literature and found that logistic regression is the most widely used method for making predictions. You're trying to test your hypothesis that neural networks can improve upon the performance of a logistic regression approach.

              h4
                | Simulate a population of 10000 people with varying risks (probabilities) of heart attack. Each patient has 10 attributes that are continuous in the domain (0, 1), with 5 attributes responsible for risk, and 5 attributes that do not affect risk. First, design a risk function that has 
                a(href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framingham_Risk_Score") clinical backing
                |. Then train a logistic regression classifier and NN classifier on the outcomes (not the risks!) of a subset of 1000 people. How do the classifiers compare? What attributes of the risk function affect the differences in performance between the classifiers?

                strong Assignment: Deep Learning For Radiology
                |  In this assignment, you're going to build a neural network that can classify common thoracic diseases. We're going to use a dataset of 100,000+ images released by the NIH 2 weeks ago! As a result, we'll be one of the first teams in the world building models on this, and have a fantastic opportunity to explore and push the cutting edge. You'll be responsible for replicating and extending ideas from the readings for the week on building convolutional neural networks, and employing transfer learning techniques, as explored in the transfer learning exercise.
              h4 Your task is to build: 
                | (1) A neural network architecture that doesn't use any transfer learning. You're not restricted in terms of the architectural choices, and
                | (2) A neural network architecture that uses transfer learning. Make sure to try out both fine-tuning, and freezing layers for a variety of pretrained models. For fine tuning, you're not restricted to changing only the final layer -- you can add extra layers, or cut out internal layers of the pretrained models.
