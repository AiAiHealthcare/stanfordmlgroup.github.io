          h2 We developed a deep neural network which can diagnose irregular heart rhythms, also known as arrhythmias, from single-lead ECG signals at a level exceeding cardiologists.
          p 
            | The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a fundamental tool in the everyday practice of clinical medicine, with more than 300 million ECGs obtained annually worldwide, and is pivotal for diagnosing a wide spectrum of arrhythmias. In 
            a(href="#") a study published in Nature Medicine
            | , we developed an algorithm to detect 12 rhythm classes from raw single-lead ECG inputs using a training dataset consisting of 91,232 ECG records from 53,549 patients.

            i Can you identify the heart arrhythmia in the above example? The neural network is able to correctly detect AVB_TYPE2. Below, you can see other abnormalities which the neural network is successfully able to detect.
